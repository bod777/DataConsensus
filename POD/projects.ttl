        dct:description           "The third party is an Irish health insurance company. They are interested in accessing the CGM data to gain insights into glucose patterns and develop risk assessment models for their policyholders. They aim to analyse the data to identify patterns that could help them understand the relationship between glucose levels and health outcomes, particularly in individuals with diabetes. The insurance company states a number of benefits if the research proceeds. These  benefits include more efficient and accurate underwriting for diabetes patients, more personalised insurance products, as well as incentives and rewards to policyholders for managing their glucose levels effectively. The purpose for the data request is commercial research but they commit to not selling it with any unauthorised parties, though they may sell the insights. The company follows the guidance from Insurance Ireland and has stringent cybersecurity and data protection measures. These include GDPR training and regular cybersecurity training for all its staff. The staff have also all signed NDAs regarding any personal data. All computer systems within their organisation require two factor authentication, as well as encryption. Additionally, the company also has a designated data protection officer responsible for overseeing compliance with privacy regulations. Furthermore, the company employs encryption during storage and transmission, with industry-leading cryptography. There are also network security protocols and on-site physical security control. Regular compliance monitoring procedures and a certification system are in place to ensure ongoing adherence to data protection regulations. In the event of any unauthorised data processing or data loss incidents, the company has a well-defined plan for managing and reporting the incident. The patient group carefully evaluates the request and deliberate on it amongst themselves. Comments posted on the DataConsensus platform below the data request include many negative ones such as “While the security measures seem good, I just don't know if I trust an insurance company with my health data. They definitely have ulterior motives.”  While the constraints outlined above are stringent and well-thought out, a number of members don’t trust the intentions of the insurance company and successfully convince a majority of members that with this data, the insurance company could increase insurance premiums for diabetes patients. Following this, the group voted on the request and they rejected the request." ;

        dct:description           "The third party is a newly established nonprofit organisation looking to improve healthcare resources for people with diabetes. Their mission is predominantly advocacy focused but they want to be data-led and evidence-driven. Therefore, they desire the blood sugar data to better understand the needs of diabetes patients. Still, the exact aim of their research is not stated and it appears to be mostly exploratory. As they are a new organisation with limited resources, they have opted for more relaxed data protection measures. They do not have a designated data protection officer and do not have training or a code of conduct for their staff to follow. They do have standard operating system security and password authentication but cannot guarantee encryption at rest. They do commit to not selling the data or sharing it with unauthorised parties. They have also requested a very long duration of 20 years for the research. This request prompts a significant discussion among the members of the group. Although concerned about data protection, many members believe in the nonprofit organisation's good intentions and their potential to make a positive impact. Therefore, one member proposes a counter offer. The initial request is rejected during the request deliberation and following this, the counter offer is discussed and voted on by the group. The group approves of the counter offer and the system forwards it onto the requester. After reviewing the offer and adjusting their operations, the nonprofit agrees to the counter offer. Once granted access by the application's users, the nonprofit accesses the pseudo-anonymised data from the DataConsensus pod. The data will then be analysed using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and other research techniques to identify patterns, associations, and trends. At the data agreed upon, any duplicate data files of the pod data will be destroyed. " ;

        dct:description           "The third party is a Principal Investigator (PI) at a respected academic research institution. They are leading a research project examining how glucose patterns of diabetes patients vary through the day. The DataConsensus data pool provides a straightforward way for the project to gain the glucose patterns data they need to complete the research. The PI believes this research will provide more evidence-based recommendations for how people with diabetes should manage their glucose levels. The PI plans on publishing a paper on this research, which will also benefit the wider scientific community researching glucose and will likely lead to further research ideas. In terms of the data request’s purpose, it will be solely academic research and the PI plans to use the data only for this specific project. The research project will also not sell the data nor sell any insights from the data. The PI is working with a PhD student and a data scientist, both a part of the academic institution. As such, the PI, PhD and data scientist will all have access to the data in order to complete the research. The academic research institution the PI is a part of mandates that all staff members take formal cybersecurity and data protection training. The institution mandates that all researchers follow an ethical code of conduct. The institution also promotes a Privacy by Design approach to any research project. The institution also employs a data protection officer, who has been consulted on this project. The data will be stored and transferred securely using encryption and access to the data will only be granted through password authentication. There are also compliance monitoring procedures and a plan in place for incident reporting if there is any unauthorised data processing. The data will only be processed in Ireland and won’t be shared with any International collaborators. Given the thorough constraints listed above, the trusted reputation of the organisation and the altruistic purpose of the research, the sentiment among the data group is very positive and the members overwhelmingly vote to approve the data request. Once granted access by the application's users, the academic research institution accesses the pseudo-anonymised data from the DataConsensus pod. The data will then be analysed using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and other research techniques to identify patterns, associations, and trends.
