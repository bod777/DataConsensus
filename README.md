# DataConsensus
 
Repo of my dissertation. The research question proposed is "How to enable data cooperatives to collaboratively deliberate and decide on data requests from third parties." and I am building off of the work completed in a previous dissertation in collaborative
data governance. The application, called DataConsensus is powered by SOLID and is designed to enable collaborative discussion and rule management within groups of members.
